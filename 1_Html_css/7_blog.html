					Say hello to our dormitory cat, Piggy! You can easily guess why he's called that. He's pretty fat, and very soft to touch...
				</p>
				<p>
					He likes being petted, basking in the sunlight, and eating some snacks. His favorite food is Ciao Churu: a soup-like catfood that tastes like tuna, salmon, or chicken. But he's so generous that he sometimes yields his Churu to a younger cat.
